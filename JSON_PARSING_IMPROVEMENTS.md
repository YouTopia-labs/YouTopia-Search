# JSON Parsing Improvements

## Problem Solved
Fixed critical JSON parsing errors in the agent orchestrator that were causing system failures when Agent 1 returned responses with explanatory text instead of pure JSON.

## Error Examples That Are Now Prevented
```
[Warning] Direct JSON parse failed on cleaned response. Attempting brace extraction...
SyntaxError: JSON Parse error: Unexpected identifier "Based"
[Error] Agent 1 response does not contain a valid JSON structure (missing or malformed braces).
```

## Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Agent 1 Prompt (`agents/agent1_prompt.js`)
- **Added explicit JSON-only requirements** with clear examples of what NOT to do
- **Added warning examples** showing common mistakes like starting with "Based on the provided data..."
- **Emphasized critical format requirements** multiple times throughout the prompt
- **Added final reminder** at the end of the prompt

### 2. Robust JSON Parsing (`agents/agent_orchestrator.js`)
- **Multi-strategy parsing approach**:
  1. Direct JSON parse (for properly formatted responses)
  2. Cleanup strategy (removes prefixes, markdown, backticks)
  3. Brace extraction (finds JSON object boundaries)
- **Enhanced error logging** with detailed information about parsing failures
- **Better error messages** that guide developers to the root cause

### 3. Comprehensive Response Validation
- **Field validation** ensuring all required fields are present
- **Value validation** checking that classification and action values are valid
- **Conditional validation** ensuring dependent fields are present when needed
- **Clear error reporting** with specific validation failure details

### 4. Automatic Retry Mechanism
- **Smart retry logic** that detects invalid JSON responses
- **Enhanced prompting** for retries with stricter JSON requirements
- **Temperature adjustment** (lower temperature for retries to increase consistency)
- **Maximum retry limit** to prevent infinite loops

### 5. Improved Error Handling
- **Structured error messages** that clearly indicate the problem
- **Detailed logging** for debugging purposes
- **Graceful degradation** when parsing fails completely

## Key Features

### Strict JSON Validation
```javascript
// Validates that response starts with { and ends with }
if (!trimmed.startsWith('{') || !trimmed.endsWith('}')) {
  throw new Error('Response does not start with { or end with }');
}
```

### Multi-Strategy Parsing
```javascript
// Strategy 1: Direct parse
// Strategy 2: Remove prefixes and markdown
// Strategy 3: Extract JSON by brace matching
```

### Comprehensive Field Validation
- Required fields: `classification`, `reasoning`
- Conditional fields based on classification and action
- Valid enum values for classification and action

### Automatic Retry with Enhanced Prompting
```javascript
if (retryCount > 0) {
  messages.push({ 
    role: 'system', 
    content: `CRITICAL: Your previous response was not valid JSON. You MUST respond with ONLY a JSON object starting with { and ending with }. NO explanatory text before or after the JSON. NO markdown. NO conversational language.` 
  });
}
```

## Testing
The improvements have been tested with:
- ✅ The exact problematic response from the error logs
- ✅ Valid JSON responses to ensure they still work
- ✅ Edge cases with markdown formatting and prefixes

## Benefits
1. **Eliminates JSON parsing errors** that were causing system failures
2. **Provides clear feedback** when responses are malformed
3. **Automatically retries** with stricter instructions
4. **Maintains backward compatibility** with properly formatted responses
5. **Improves debugging** with detailed error logging

## Usage
No changes required for existing code. The improvements are automatically applied when calling `orchestrateAgents()`.

## Future Considerations
- Monitor retry rates to identify if certain models need additional prompting adjustments
- Consider adding response format examples directly in the system prompt
- Evaluate if additional validation rules are needed based on real-world usage
